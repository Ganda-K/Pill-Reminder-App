**PILL REMAINDER APP**
A pill reminder app is a program that helps users keep track of their medication schedules by providing reminders to take their pills on time. Here is a detailed explanation of how a basic pill reminder app works:

1. User inputs medication information: The user inputs information about their medications, including the name of the medication, dosage, frequency, and time of day they need to take it.

2. Schedule is created: The app uses this information to create a medication schedule for the user, which lists when each medication should be taken.

3. Reminders are set: The app sets reminders to notify the user when it is time to take their medication. These reminders can be set up as push notifications or pop-up alerts on the user's phone or computer.

4. Reminders are delivered: When it is time to take the medication, the app sends a reminder to the user, alerting them to take their medication.

5. User confirms medication intake: The user confirms that they have taken their medication by checking off a box or tapping a button within the app.

6. App updates schedule: Once the user confirms that they have taken their medication, the app updates the medication schedule to reflect that the medication has been taken. 

7. Repeat the cycle: The app will continue to send reminders for the user's medication schedule until all the medications have been taken for the day.
